# Customer Data Segmentation Segmenting customer data using the K-means algorithm. Clustering refers to the process of grouping similar items together based on their characteristics or attributes.

Customer segmentation is an essential undertaking in marketing and business strategy, with the goal of categorizing a customer base into clusters that share similar characteristics and behaviors. This project utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation, grouping customers according to their purchasing behavior. Functioning Mechanism


Data preprocessing: initial step in which the customer data is prepared for analysis. This includes tasks such as cleaning the data, normalizing it, and performing feature engineering. The dataset comprises diverse attributes, including customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

Feature selection: involves the process of choosing specific characteristics that are relevant to the business objectives in order to perform segmentation. In this scenario, clustering is performed based on features associated with purchasing behavior, specifically annual income and spending score.

K-means clustering: The chosen characteristics are subsequently utilized as input for the K-means clustering algorithm. K-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that divides the data into K clusters according to their similarity in the feature space. The algorithm employs an iterative process where it assigns data points to the closest cluster centroid and then updates the centroids until they reach a state of convergence.

Analysis and Interpretation: Following the clustering process, the resulting segments are examined and interpreted to obtain a deeper understanding of customer behavior. This may entail the process of mentally representing the clusters, analyzing the central points of the clusters, and comparing the distinct attributes of each segment.


Objective

Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by cleaning missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features for segmentation, such as those related to purchasing behavior.
Model Training: Train the K-means clustering model using the selected features.
Segmentation: Use the trained model to segment the customer data into clusters based on purchasing behavior.
Analysis and Interpretation: Analyze the resulting clusters to understand customer segments and their characteristics.
